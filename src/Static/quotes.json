    "Your future belongs to me",
    "I'm glad Yukkis mother is a good person, I didn't have to use any of the tools I brought",
    "I'm the only friend you need",
    "I was practically dead, but you gave me a future. Yukki is my hope in life, but if it won't come true then I will die for Yukki, and even in death I will chase after Yukki",
    "They are all planning to betray you!!!",
    "What's insane is this world that won't let me and Yukki be together!",
    "A half moon, it has a dark half and a bright half, just like meâ€¦",
    "Everything in this world is just a game and we are merely the pawns.",
    "Breaking curfew is 3 demerits. 3 demerits gets the cage, the cage means no food."
